TOJam8 has just come to a close and boy, was it a great one.

#### My Gameplan/Concept

After a ambitious 6-man project last year


I keep doing these server-oriented HTML games; I can't get off it and I'm not sure why.
There was a ton of teams using Unity this year and I heard of a few other builder names dropped.
I'm pretty wowed by what people do with these builders in just a few days and it makes me want to learn more about harnessing those tools.
They seem to really let you focus on game mechanics by giving you a massive foundation to build on and the results are astonishing.
